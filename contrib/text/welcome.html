<strong>Welcome, Surfer!</strong>
</P>

You already know what Ghostzilla is. Now you will learn how to use it.
<em>You may want to jump right on the program, but you absolutely
have to read the basic instructions or you won’t get anywhere.
</em><br>
<br>
The first part of the document is the very short
<a href="#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a>
section. The second part,
<a href="#GhostzillaManual">Ghostzilla Manual</a>,
gives you more details on everyday use.
Read it right after you get the idea from <I>Getting Started</I> how to ride
the Web with Ghostzilla. It isn’t long either and you will have a good time
exploring the options.
<br>
<br>
Legal note: you must agree to the terms of Ghostzilla
<a href="license.txt">license agreement</a> to use Ghostzilla.<br><br>

<div align="center">
<P><a name="GettingStarted" id="GettingStarted"/><font size="+2" color="#0000FF"><strong>Getting Started With Ghostzilla-CD</strong></font></P>
</div>

Don’t run the program yet! Read all the instructions first, than come back and start Ghostzilla.
<br>
<OL>
	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Find it: </strong></font>
	The program is called <I>Start-Ghostzilla-CD.exe</I> and you’ll find it in the same
	folder where this manual is. Run it from Windows Explorer, or click
	<A HREF="Start-Ghostzilla-CD.exe">here</A> to run it from your browser.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Say No: </strong></font>
	A dialog will appear. Click on "No". (If you have run Ghostzilla-CD successfully before,
	you can click "Yes.") We’ll explain this important dialog in the next section.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Wait:</strong></font>
	Wait until the program loads. It may seem that nothing is happening, but you will know
	by the flashing of your CD drive’s lamp that Ghostzilla is on its way. It may take
	anywhere from ten seconds on a fast CD to a full minute on a very old one for the program
	to load. Please don’t touch the mouse and keyboard until Ghostzilla shows up,
	if this is the first time you’re running it.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>See:</strong></font>
	Ghostzilla will appear inside Explorer. You will see a grayish "Welcome to Ghostzilla"
	page with a thin menu bar above it.
	<BR><BR>
	If it doesn’t show up after a minute or so, and the CD drive lamp is not blinking anymore
	(you may also see another task on the taskbar, saying "Ghostzilla" or "Ghost..."),
	go to step 6.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Hide:</strong></font>
	Move the mouse slowly towards the Ghostzilla window. Try to move the scrollbar on the "Welcome"
	page down, but don’t let the cursor leave the window area. Then, when you’re ready,
	move the mouse away from Ghostzilla window and watch it disappear!
	This is how you make the browser vanish when you want -- just move the mouse away from the window.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Show:</strong></font>
	To bring Ghostzilla back from hiding, do the following: touch the LEFT edge of the entire
	screen with your mouse cursor; then move it all the way across to touch the RIGHT edge;
	then again move it all the way across to touch the LEFT edge of the screen. This is the
	signal for the browser, which has been hidden but listening, to come back.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Play:</strong></font>
 	Play with Ghostzilla for a while; read the Welcome page, or click on the address bar
	and type some Web address. If at any moment Ghostzilla disappears because you moved
	the mouse too far, bring it back with the mouse movement described in step 6.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Close:</strong></font>
	Now select the "Exit" menu option and close Ghostzilla.
	<BR><BR>
	</LI>

	<LI><font color="#000000"><strong>Say Yes:</strong></font>
	A dialog similar to the one you’ve seen at startup will appear. Click "Yes" and it
	will close.
	<BR>
	</LI>
</OL>

That’s it -- now start Ghostzilla and follow these steps. When you’re done, you will have
learned the most important lesson: how to start, hide, show, and quit Ghostzilla.
Then read the next section, the Ghostzilla Manual, to learn the mastery of clandestine
surfing.

<P><a name="Manual_what"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>What is Ghostzilla-CD?</strong></font></P>

Ghostzilla-CD is the CD-only, no-installation version, of the clandestine, invisible, camouflage
(there are a few descriptions) Web browser Ghostzilla.<br>
<br>
Ghostzilla browser is your tool against those around you who look at your screen to see if you're surfing
the Web. With Ghostzilla, all they see is your normal work screen; only you see the Web page inside it,
rendered to look just like your work from more than a couple of feet. But if they come as close to
the screen as you are, your simple moving the mouse away will make already barely visible Ghostzilla
vanish without trace. When the coast clears, your another simple mouse move will bring Ghostzilla back.
<br>
<br>
Ghostzilla-CD has one additional, but indispensible feature: <b> it runs directly from CD, without any installation</b>.
During your browsing session, it creates some temporary files in Windows TEMP directory, but removes them all on exit.
This way it leaves no trace of activity. On exit, only your personal settings
(preferences, bookmarks, passwords, history),
the so-called <i>user profile</i>, are stored in a small, portable, encrypted archive, at the folder of your choice
(Ghostzilla-CD never writes into Windows registry).<br>
<br>
You can even chose to archive the profile on a <i>floppy</i> than you can carry along with Ghostzilla-CD. Armed with Ghostzilla-CD
and the floppy with your profile archive, you can surf surreptitiously on multiple computers, without leaving trace on any one of them,
always keeping your settings with you.<br>
<br>
Ghostzilla is derived from today's most powerful browser, Mozilla, version 1.0.1.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_starting"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Starting</strong></font></P>

When you first run Ghostzilla from the CD, it offers to restore your profile (more about it
<a href="#Manual_profiles">later</a>), and loads in memory. When it loads, it blends itself
with your work screen. You only see its thin menu bar, address bar, and this welcome page.<br>
<br>
Click on the address bar (or press <i>F6</i>), type the address of the Web site you want to visit,
and press Enter. Your page should come up
in a second; Ghostzilla guesses your network proxy settings so you don't need to do any setup. In rare
cases where the guess doesn't work, set the proxies by choosing <i>Setup->Network Proxies</i> menu option.<br>
<br>
The page will be gray on white, and you won't see any big pictures. It has to be so to avoid
attention. But if you move your mouse over a picture's frame, the picture will show; by default, in black and white.
Soon you will see how you can <a href="#Manual_hidingLevel">control</a> this appearance.<br>
<br>
It might help you to know how Ghostzilla works: it finds a topmost window of your current application,
and shows itself on top of that window. This is why it appears Ghostzilla becomes a part of your work application,
but it really doesn't change anything in it. Ghostzilla first looks for a convenient window in the center of the
screen, and if it doesn't find one, it looks around.
<br>
<br>



<P><a name="Manual_hiding"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Hiding</strong></font></P>

You know already that the browser disappears if you move your mouse away. This is what you do
if someone is approaching your screen: just move the mouse pointer away (up is most convenient), and let the original application
shine through. This move will send Ghostzilla into hiding, inactive but listening,
and waiting for you to summon it back.
<br>
<br>


<P><a name="Manual_showing"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Showing</strong></font></P>

When you are ready to surf again, do the LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT movement: move the mouse all the way to the
left of the entire screen, then all the way to the right, and again all the way to the left. Ghostzilla
will show up again perfectly blended with your work screen, even if you changed it meanwhile. But the
page it will show will be exactly at the point where you were when you hid it.<br>
<br>
Think of this move as rubbing a magic lamp to get the ghost out -- you have to rub the lamp just
right, all the way to the edges and reasonably quickly, for release to happen.
<br>
<br>


<P><a name="Manual_quitting"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Quitting</strong></font></P>

When you are ready to call it a day, choose the <i>Exit</i> option, or press <i>Ctrl-Q</i>. That will
completely unload Ghostzilla from memory.
On exit, Ghostzilla will offer to store your personal settings in an archive
(again, details <a href="#Manual_profiles">later</a>),
and then it will remove all the files it has created during your browsing session (in Windows TEMP directory).
There will be no Ghostzilla files left on your PC, except for the archive. The archive can be anywhere
you chose, even on the floppy, it is small and can be encrypted, as we will see.
<br>
<br>



<P><a name="Manual_menu"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Menu Options</strong></font></P>

Ghostzilla has a few more menu options than you typically see, because it doesn't have a toolbar.
Here are the options you can use:<br>
<br>
		<table align="center" border="1" width="80%">
		<tr>
			<td width="20%"><FONT SIZE=2><u>O</u>pen</FONT></td>

		</table>
<br>
To access a menu option from the keyboard, press Alt and the underlined option letter.
For example, <em>Alt-C</em> will take you one page ba<u>c</u>k.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_multiplePages"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Multiple Pages</strong></font></P>

Unlike Internet Explorer, Ghostzilla has only one window for the Web. But that window is capable of showing
multiple pages from different sites. This is called <i>tabbed browsing</i>. To see how it works,
just click on <em>New</em> menu option and another <em>tab</em> will appear. Enter the new address and
the page will load. To go back to the first page, just click on its tab. To close a tab, click on the
little "x" icon to the right of all tabs.<br>
<br>
The other way to open multiple pages is to right click on a link, and select <em>Open in New Tab</em>
option. Sometimes you may want the option below that one, <em>Open Link in Background Tab</em>. This is perfect
for search engines: you see three or four links to pages you might like, so you open them all in
background tabs, and let the browser fetch them while you continue reading your main search page.<br>
<br>
In Ghostzilla, pop-up windows are disabled. Ads and unwanted pages won't be able to surprise and annoy you.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_hidingLevel"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Appearance</strong></font></P>

You can control how "ghostly" Web pages will be, by selecting <em>Setup->Hiding Level</em> menu option.
Ghostzilla supports the following levels, for your hiding pleasure:<br><br>

		<table align="center" border="1" width="80%">
		<tr>
			<td width="20%"><FONT SIZE=2>Level 1</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				the Web page looks like in any browser, with full colors and even big pictures always shown,
				but the page disappears when you move the mouse away
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>Level 2</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				the page is black and white, but big pictures are shown in color
				(when you move the mouse over them, as with all levels below)
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>Level 3</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				the page is black and white, big pictures are also black and white
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>Level 4</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				the page is gray, big pictures are colored
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>Level 5</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				<strong>(default)</strong> the page is gray, big pictures are black and white
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>Level 6</FONT></td>
			<td><FONT SIZE=2>
				the page is gray, big pictures are also gray and pale
			</FONT></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
<br>
When you change the hiding level, you may not notice the change immediately, because some pictures are cached.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_shrinking"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Shrinking and Enlarging</strong></font></P>

The easiest way to control the size of the Ghostzilla window is to resize the windows of your work application
to your liking before activating Ghostzilla. Another way is to press the <em>CTRL</em> key and the <em>UP</em> or <em>DOWN</em>
arrow within Ghostzilla -- <em>CTRL+UP</em> will shrink Ghostzilla window, <em>CTRL+DOWN</em> will enlarge it.<br>
<br>
At any time, you can press the keys <em>CTRL</em> and "[" (left angle bracket) together to shrink the letters
of the Web page you are looking at. Keys <em>CTRL</em> and "]" (right angle bracket) will enlarge the text,
and <em>CTRL</em> and "=" together will set the letters back to the original size.<br>
<br>
You can shrink the window and the text so much that even someone sitting next to you will likely be unable to see
that you're surfing the Web.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_google"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Searching Web with Google</strong></font></P>

Ghostzilla has built-in search with Google engine. Just type your search query (for example, type
<em>stealth surfing</em>) in the address bar as if you would on Google directly, and press the <em>Up</em> arrow key and
then Enter. Google search on your phrase will be automatically performed.
<br>
<br>




<P><a name="Manual_shortcuts"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong></font></P>

Other than the Alt-underlined letter shortcuts you see from the menu, use these shortcuts as well to speed
your navigation: <br>

<P><a name="Manual_profiles"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Keeping Your Profile</strong></font></P>

A browser like Internet Explorer creates, uses, and expects to find, numerous files on your PC: your personal
settings, browser cache, etc. Ghostzilla doesn't expect to find anything on your system when you start it,
and doesn't leave anything on your PC when you exit it. All the files it needs, it stores in Windows <em>temporary</em>
directory, and removes them all on exit.<br>
<br>
However, you will want to have your personal settings remembered: your bookmarks, history, passwords, certificates,
preferences; but you don't want to leave them on the PC you use. On exit, Ghostzilla-CD lets you store those settings
in a small <strong>profile archive</strong>, that it puts in "My Documents" folder (by default; you can pick the name and location).
That way, no one can know, by looking at files on your PC, that you have used (and will use) Ghostzilla.<br>
<br>
You can further protect the archive with a password. And, best protection of all, you can choose to store the
archive on a <strong>floppy</strong>! This way, you can bring your settings with you, and move from PC to PC
with Ghostzilla-CD and your floppy, never leaving files around and always having your personal settings with you.<br>
<br>
Let's start with what happens when you exit Ghostzilla-CD, after your first session. You will see a dialog like this:<br>
<br>
		<table align="center"  border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="450"

Read the text carefully. If you press "Yes", your current profile will be archived
in <em>c:\My Documents\profile.ar</em>, unless you choose otherwise. You can enter
a password if you want to encrypt your archive.<br>
<br>
By default, the "delete all profile files" filed is checked, and we recommend you
leave it that way. If checked, whether you chose to archive your profile or not,
the temporary files, a proof that you have used Ghostzilla, will be removed.<br>
<br>
If you choose to use a non-standard folder and name for your profile, you can choose
to remember that location; that location will be stored in your Windows registry
under an obscure name and encrypted -- unlikely to ever be seen by anyone else -- but it's safest
if you don't use this option.<br>
<br>
So now, after you exited Ghostzilla-CD, your profile is stored in an archive. The next time
you start Ghostzilla-CD, you will be offered to restore the profile you archived the
last time. You will see a dialog like this:<br>

		                then all the way to the right, and then all the

If you select "No" (or press Escape key), Ghostzilla will start with a default profile.
If you select "Yes", it will restore your previous profile. If you protected your profile
archive with a password, you must enter that password now.

<P><a name="Manual_caution"/><font size="+1" color="#0000FF"><strong>Caution</strong></font></P>

When you surf with Ghostzilla, keep in mind that your school or company server automatically logs
every Web access you or anyone else makes. Some companies routinely search these logs for names of
pornographic or offensive sites. If you access those sites, this information will be recorded
in the logs, whether you use Ghostzilla or anything else.<br>
<br>
Therefore, do not visit such sites. You may also want to use plain Mozilla browser (from time to time
at least) for your regular, overt surfing, since Mozilla and Ghostzilla have the same "browser signature."
You can find a copy of Mozilla on this CD.<br>
<br>
To learn more about Mozilla, visit <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla.org</a>.<br>
<br>
Most surfing options that apply to Mozilla, work in Ghostzilla, too. Those options that work against
the goals of secrecy and invisibility, are disabled. Check the <em>Help</em> menu option to learn about Mozilla features.
